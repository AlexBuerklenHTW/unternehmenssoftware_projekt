The negotiation between Paul and Sarah was well-handled, with both parties expressing their needs and making compromises.
Sarah did thorough research and was able to provide evidence to support her offer. Paul was open to negotiation and met Sarah halfway, showing a fair and reasonable approach.
However, the deal could be slightly more advantageous for Sarah considering the current market value of the iPhone 13.

The conversation ended on a positive note with a clear plan for payment and shipping details. Both parties are satisfied with the agreement and looking forward to finalizing the transaction.
