The scale starts from 1 being a bad deal for the seller and a good deal for the buyer to 10 being a bad deal for the buyer and a good deal for the seller.
Example: 1 could be if the seller goes under his pain limit and sells under his limit and the buyer bought under his target goal of the budget. 10 could be if the buyer bought over the
budget limit and the seller sold for the target price.
